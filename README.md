multiple year stock data: 2018-2020

1.) VBA Script that loops through all stocks for one year and outputs following information on all worksheets:

    ' The ticker symbol
    ' Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    ' The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    ' The total stock volume of the stock.
    
2.) Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

The purpose of this stock analysis was to account for the yearly change and total stock volume per stock per year.

Results were achieved through using if/then/else statements, For loops, ws.activate, Max/Mix function, and conditional formatting scripts.
